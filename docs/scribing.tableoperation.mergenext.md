## TableOperation.mergeNext() method

Returns an operation that keeps the intention of the current operation and the specified subsequent operation as they were performed as an atomic operation.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
mergeNext(next: FlowOperation): FlowOperation | null;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  next | [FlowOperation](./scribing.flowoperation.md) | The next operation to be merged |

<b>Returns:</b>

[FlowOperation](./scribing.flowoperation.md) \| null

## Remarks

Although a batch operation can fulfill the purpose of keeping the intent of both operations, the idea is that this method shall NOT return a batch, but only return a non-null result when the current operation can be rewritten to include the intention of the subsequent operation too.
