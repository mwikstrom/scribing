## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [afterInsertFlow(other)](./scribing.flowbatch.afterinsertflow.md) |  | Transforms the current operation so that its intent is preserved after the specified range was inserted. |
|  [afterRemoveFlow(other)](./scribing.flowbatch.afterremoveflow.md) |  | Transforms the current operation so that its intent is preserved after the specified range was removed. |
|  [applyToContent(content, theme)](./scribing.flowbatch.applytocontent.md) |  | Applies the current operation on the specified content and returns the updated result. |
|  [applyToSelection(selection, mine)](./scribing.flowbatch.applytoselection.md) |  | Applies the current operation on the specified selection and returns the updated result. |
|  [fromArray(operations)](./scribing.flowbatch.fromarray.md) | <code>static</code> | Gets a single operation that represents the specified array of operations, or <code>null</code> when the specified array is empty. |
|  [fromData(data)](./scribing.flowbatch.fromdata.md) | <code>static</code> | Gets a [FlowBatch](./scribing.flowbatch.md) from the specified data |
|  [invert(content)](./scribing.flowbatch.invert.md) |  | Returns an operation that negates the effect of the current operation. |
|  [mergeNext(next)](./scribing.flowbatch.mergenext.md) |  | Returns an operation that keeps the intention of the current operation and the specified subsequent operation as they were performed as an atomic operation. |
